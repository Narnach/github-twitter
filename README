github-twitter
===============

Toss your github pushes to Twitter. All props go to jnewland for the idea (http://github.com/jnewland/github-campfire/tree/master) and to jnunemaker for the first version (http://github.com/jnunemaker/github-twitter).

I resurrected the project because I wanted the post-receive twitter hook of github to show me the commit message of each commit. The latest version of the Twitter gem is now required, as well as the bitly gem for URL shortening.

requirements
============
sudo gem install json twitter sinatra bitly

instructions
============
cp config.yml.example config.yml
nano config.yml
rackup config.ru
